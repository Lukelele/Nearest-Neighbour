Parallel Nearest Neighbour Finding Algorithm using OpenMP and MPI
---

The project compares different implementations of the nearest neighbour algorithm, significant speed up was achieved using parallelisation through MPI and OpenMP in large scale systems. The cell list algorithm was found to perform much faster in large systems compared to a brute force approach.
